      "- **Four Features**: Asymmetry, hyper-evolution, omni-use, and autonomy are characteristics of the coming wave that exacerbate containment challenges.\n",
      "- **Fragility Amplifiers**: Technologies that could destabilize nation-states by amplifying existing vulnerabilities.\n",
      "- **The Grand Bargain**: The social contract between citizens and states, where states maintain order and harness technology while minimizing harm.\n",
